# NE_scRNAseq
Data files and notebook scRNA-seq) for quantile normalization. Bulk RNA-seq datasets of 239 lung neuroendocrine neoplasms (Alcala et al., 2019; Fernandez-Cuesta et al., 2014; Laddha et al., 2019) were obtained from  <https://nextjournal.com/rarecancersgenomics/a-molecular-map-of-lung-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/>, and the histopathologic classification in the attributes metadata file was used to identify the 111 typical and atypical lung carcinoids whose expression profiles of peptidergic genes and PNEC markers were analyzed here. Log-transformed gene read counts were normalized by quantile normalization.
